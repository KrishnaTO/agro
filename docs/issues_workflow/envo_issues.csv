1226,"Documentation: no NTR should ever subclass a non-ENVO class","cmungall","open",10,"2021-10-27T19:11:46Z"," * See #1105. 

If you are making an NTR to ENVO, every one of your terms MUST subclass at least one ENVO class (or use an ENVO class in a genus) and MUST NOT assert a subclass axiom to any non-ENVO class

Only core ENVO editors should ever subclass to BFO, CHEBI, OBI, etc. If you think you really need to subclass a non-ENVO class, open a specific issue just for this one case and we will discuss. In some cases it may transpire we need to better document our DPs.

For example, we should not subclass CHEBI. Instead subclass material, and used composed-primarily-of to link to CHEBI. ENVO represents a different level of granularity than CHEBI.

(Furthermore, I think even core ENVO editors should ONLY subclass ENVO or COB, but that is for another issue)

Rationale: subclassing non-ENVO classes is poor modularization and leads to issues. Additionally the axioms are likely wrong (see my comments on bottle in #1105) 

Aside: OWL is a very powerful language that allows you to do all kinds of interesting things weaving together different ontologies, but a good rule of thumb is **keep it simple** and avoid trying to do anything clever.

Indicate whether you are in favor with a comment +1, -1, +0 with any additional comments.

I used the dedicated ID range for that specific pattern to create IDs for the new terms. 
I added my terms directly to the corresponding module, and then ran the command that was in the Makefile for making the the modules (dosdp generate and robot annotate). 

When looking at the diffs of the entity_attribute_location.owl file that I got in return, I see that one term ('concentration of oxygen in water') was obsoleted at some point, but because I ran the make module command again, the term is created again. See here: https://github.com/marieALaporte/envo/commit/d093bf0eaa9d3914762839c7403a28186c7d06cf

I understand that what I am trying to do it different from what is described in the Wiki. I preferred to use the pattern approach as we have a bunch of concentration and composition terms that we would like to propose to ENVO (we have several issues open for those), and it is a great approach to add both the terms and the equivalent axioms in one shot. 

Could you please advise what should be done here? Many thanks !

1209,"Create design patterns for biome and ecosystem","cmungall","open",6,"2021-09-07T17:30:41Z","Currently there is inconsistent classification between biome and ecosystem, exemplified here:

 * #1208. 

terrestrial biome = 
biome
 and ('determined by' some 
    ('planetary landmass' or ('part of' some 'planetary landmass')))

def: ""A biome which is  primarily or completely situated on a landmass.""

Note the large deviation between textual def and logical def, this is a red flag see [S11 text and logical defs should match](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/ontotip-write-simple-concise-clear-operational-textual-definitions/)

(FWIW it seems the logical definition is problematic)

terrestial ecosystem has no logical definition and no textual definition.

My understanding is that ""X biome"" should always be classified under ""X ecosystem"", and what differentiates the child from the parent is that the child has reached climax state. See #787 for full discussion.

If we are agreed on this (can you confirm @pbuttigieg), I recommend:

 * creating a characteristic ""in climax state"". This could live in ENVO or PATO
 * creating a DP for ""X biome = X ecosystem and has-characteristic some in-climax-state""
 * making the textual definitions reflect this

I also recommend regularizing the DPs for ecosystems but this can be discussed in a separate ticket.

I also recommend avoid single-children and naming the non-climax state siblings but we can also discuss this in a separate ticket

Note: my personal preference is to only have a single concept and if people need to annotate an ecosystem as being in a climax state they do this with a field in their database rather than pre-composing shadow classes. However, my current proposal above is conservative and allows ENVO to retain the dual ecosystem and biome classes.

1205,"Modeling of earthquakes in envo","cmungall","open",1,"2021-08-27T16:04:38Z","Carried on from #1182. 

Note: we should not block progress on #1182, that ticket needs to be fixed ASAP as currently the release version of ENVO has DL errors in it. We should close that ticket with a fix that remains close to the current axioms. Then at our leisure we can discuss long term modeling in this ticket.

Currently earthquake-plate relationships are modeled as has-participant. Is this ideal?

@dr-shorthair puts it well:

_Earthquake is a tricky one._

_From an engineering viewpoint, an earthquake is ground movement (vibration) at a location, as a result of various source phenomena at a distance. The characteristic properties are time, amplitude, acceleration etc at the observing location._

_From the viewpoint of most geologists and geophysicists, the earthquake is the source phenomenon. Usually underground fault-slippage or fracturing, but maybe cavity collapse, an underground explosion, etc. The characteristic properties are location, timing, focal-mechanism, moment, etc of the natural or artificial phenomenon at the source._

_These phenomena are causally related, but different, though often given the same name._

I suspect ENVO will want to focus on the latter view, and we would have separate processes to represent the causal effects, but we should discuss this

For the geological view, it points to a simple occurs_in relation between quakes and plates and plate-oriented entities, e.g

 * plate
    * plate boundary
    * region of overlap between two plates
    * etc

earthqake is currently under material transport process - does this fit well with both views above?"
1204,"No rain forest term?","turbomam","open",3,"2021-08-20T14:07:18Z","""rain forest"" is in one of the ROBOT-style Google Sheets that I've been asked to review and execute. The proposed definition is 

> A forest ecosystem which has tall and mostly evergreen trees characterized by a closed and continuous tree canopy and a high amount of annual rainfall

I think this is an example of a term that appears in the [annotation of a environmental biosample in GOLD](https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/biosamples?page=1&Biosample.Biosample+Name=rain+forest)

The only place I currently see 'rain.?forest' in EnvO is [tropical lowland evergreen broadleaf rain forest](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FENVO_01000384)

- the predominant type of leaves observed in a forest
- the prevailing climate
- the continuity of the canopy, etc.

I just don't have enough knowledge about this domain to tell if I can place a new 'rain forest' as a subclass of any existing term that's more specific than ""forest ecosystem""."

... I'll also obsolete the following terms:

**Term**: [plastic production compound](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_03510039)
**Former definition**: A compound utilized for the production of plastics or polymers.
**Former comment**: Plastics are produced by the conversion of natural products or by the synthesis of primary chemicals generally coming from oil, natural gas, or coal. Plasctic production compounds typically include elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur.
**Reason for obsoletion**: This term is ambigious, as it could refer to the compound the plastic is (supposed to be) made of, additives, contaminants, etc. Please instead directly refer to the compound of interest.

**Term**: [manufactured plastic](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000404)
**Former definition**: A (portion of) plastic is an (portion of) anthropogenic environmental material including any of numerous organic synthetic or processed materials which are primarily composed of thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers of high molecular weight.
**Reason for obsoletion**: This term has been replaced by [synthetic plastic](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_06105112) as part of a more coherent set of classes as part of the SDG14.1.1 project (see https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/projects/17)

1183,"NTR: forest","cmungall","open",1,"2021-06-16T14:56:56Z","ENVO doesn't have a class with label 'forest'.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000111 ""forested area"" has a related synonym 'forest', but this is an immaterial entity:

_An area with a high density of trees. A small forest may be called a wood. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest ]_:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/122240419-9e2acd00-ce76-11eb-98eb-e6113f72280c.png)

This means that someone searching for ENVO for a concept 'forest' is likely to come across ENVO_00000111, and if they are not familiar with BFO (likely) they will look at the definition and select it for their purposes, even though this is an immaterial entity.

I don't think anyone would consider a forest to be an immaterial entity

Note that in previous versions of ENVO, ENVO_00000111 represented an actual forest, which was a material entity:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/122242059-e0084300-ce77-11eb-8a02-c7b1b35d58d6.png)

At some point parts of the feature branch were moved from material to immaterial. I think as per obo policy this should have resulted in obsoletions, as when you change a basic concept like a forest from being something material with trees as parts etc to immaterial, you are changing the meaning radically.

Note we also have an ENVO class for 'forest ecosystem', which is currently the best term for people looking for a forest concept.

Moving forward, I propose one of 3 courses of action:

 1. create a new term forest, which would related to 'forest ecosystem' the same way 'desert' relates to 'desert ecosystem'. Remove the synonym 'forest' from the immaterial class
 2. Add the string 'forest' as an exact synonym to 'forest ecosystem'. Remove the synonym 'forest' from the immaterial class
 3. Move ENVO_00000111 back under material entity, and restore the label forest"

It looks like ""_X_oxic water"" material is only used to define lakes, not marine bodies. This is reasonable, as we don't see anoxic oceans (on Earth)

conversely, we have a class for 'marine anoxic zone'

this is an immaterial entity, and is not connected to the class for 'anoxic water'

I would like to add a material entity class for the general concept of hypoxic or dead zone. But I'm unsure how to do this without clashing with existing terminological patterns.

I can make a PR but need more guidance on the existing classification philosophy

 - option 1 (simple): Add non-exact synonyms ""Xocic zone"" or ""Xoxic water"" classes
     - even though the zone connotes a large material region rather than an arbitrary portion, the concepts are close enough
 - option 2 (harder)
     - create parallel ""Xoxic region"" classes for {an,hyp,''}oxic region [of {lake,marine body}]
     - decide how 'anoxic region of marine body' relates to existing ""marine anoxic zone"" class

There are some unusual things here. If shore is part of coast, why isn't sea shore part of sea coast or lake shore part of lake coast? If beach is part of shore, why isn't sea beach part of sea shore? 

But my main question is what is the difference between beach, shore, and coast:

id: ENVO:00000091
name: beach
def: ""A landform consisting of loose rock particles such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, cobble, or even shell fragments along the shoreline of a body of water."" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach]

id: ENVO:00000304
name: shore
def: ""That part of the land in immediate contact with a body of water including the area between high and low water lines."" [USGS:SDTS]

id: ENVO:01000687
name: coast
def: ""A coast is the area where land meets the sea, ocean, or lake."" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast]

These definitions seem both imprecise and highly overlapping. Note the definition of shoreline is being discussed over on #1122  

The definitions are also from mixed sources. I would recommend using the same source for related concepts to arrive at a coherent classification. I am not a geographer so I can't recommend specific ones, but as an example of how we might approach this, we could take the NOAA shoreline definitions: https://shoreline.noaa.gov/glossary.html

This is correct, these were made in the early days

However, I am not sure these are still useful

For this class, we have two FTTs: FTT:621; FTT:624

I am not sure how to construct URLs for these, if I try

- Don't use complex subclass axioms (e.g., X and (part of some Y) and (located in some Z). Instead list the list each subclass axiom individually.
- Stick to with axioms that ELK can use for inference. I think ELK cannot use the following (but my list may be incomplete):
    - distinct individuals

1051,"definition of environmental system/environment","cmungall","open",0,"2020-12-16T19:11:11Z","The definition of environmental system could be improved, to be more useful to domain scientists:

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FENVO_01000254

Def: _A system which has the disposition to environ one or more material entities._ [ http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-1480-4-43 ]

What does it mean to environ a material entity?

There is a comment that says:

_ In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class ""system"". The relation ""environed_by"" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised._

In the > 7 years since this was written there is still no BFO system class, and there is no environed_by/environs relation in ENVO

(I added 'system' to RO as a placeholder, but so far ENVO is the only ontology to use this, and it confuses people to have classes in RO. We can consider adding to COB)

The referenced paper has more information:

_We propose that an environment (synonymous with an environmental system [ENVO_01000254]) is a certain sort of system which has the disposition to environ, that is to contain within its BFO:site [BFO_0000029] and causally integrate, some BFO:material entity. Examples of environments range from rainforests to gut lumens to the interiors of virally infected cells. As described below, the subclasses of environmental system will reference environment-types familiar to most biologists._

I think it would be useful to include the examples.

Note also there is a subclass ""ecosystem"" _An environmental system which includes both living and non-living components._

However, many of the direct subclasses of environmental system have both living and non-living components, so by this definition they should be moved under ecosystem?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/102382622-7cac5f80-3f7f-11eb-820f-c4e624d3936b.png)

I have a number of (non-disjoint) proposals:

Proposal 1: change definition

I propose the definition should exclude all abstract BFO terms (""material entity"", ""disposition""). It can still use technical terms an environmental scientist would understand.

Merriam Webster has a good definition:

_the complex of physical, chemical, and biotic factors (such as climate, soil, and living things) that act upon an organism or an ecological community and ultimately determine its form and survival_

To accommodate the planetary use case we can add a hedge that the complex is *capable* of acting on an organism/community

Adding this and making the definition more conformant with OBO, I propose:

_A combination of physical objects, materials, and living entities (or their parts)  that act upon an organism or an ecological community and ultimately determine its form and survival_

Proposal 2: rename back to 'environment'

Rename 'environmental system' back to 'environment', make it a direct subclass of material entity

potentially: deprecate 'system' from RO

Proposal 3: differentiate ecosystem from environment

I would make ecosystem part of environment. For example:

_The part of an environment consisting of living and non-living components linked via nutrient cycles and energy flows _ [ISBN:978-0-534-42066-6]

However, this is more complex and may be better served as a separate ticket, as it is also tied with the ecosystem vs biome distinction (https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gp6RyMZrYskRSDonB7y8kkw9E3a8wHuqcdRDt_blhU/edit#)"

Generalizing ENVO to interplanetary use cases will have impacts on its usability for earth-based use cases. There are examples in various tickets, e.g #1034. I will add more to this ticket later.

In many ways this is analogous to the species-specific vs species-neutral anatomy ontology scenario that we have >10 years experience with (and >20 for GO). We have various techniques for dealing with this that can be applied (e.g. taxon-GCIs => planetary GCIs TODO add link). But the situation still involves compromise and things are often left unsatisfactory.

Sometimes it's necessary to have specific ontologies synchronized with the general one. This should not be off the table for ENVO. Although a complicating factor here is that there is already considerable uptake of ENVO for earth use cases (e.g microbiome) and managing a transition will be hard. But we should consider all options.

1. it's simpler

3. it's simpler
